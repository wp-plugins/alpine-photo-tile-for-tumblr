== Description == 
The Alpine PhotoTile for Tumblr is one plugin in a series that creates a way of retrieving photos from various popular sites and displaying them in a stylish and uniform way. The plugin is capable of retrieving photos from a particular Tumblr2 user or custom Tumblr2 URL. This lightweight but powerful widget takes advantage of WordPress's built in JQuery scripts to create a sleek presentation that I hope you will like. A full description and demonstration is available at [the Alpine Press](http://thealpinepress.com/alpine-phototile-for-tumblr2/ "Plugin Demo").
